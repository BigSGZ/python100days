		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		<div class="container">
			<p>
				In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster.
			</p>
			<p>
				The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood, and propelled by pushing your feed on the
				ground in a gliding movement.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained pathway. 
			</p>
			<p class="clear">
				In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the front wheel, but its wooden
				structure made it extremely uncomfortable.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel.
			</p>
			<p>
				Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its
					predecessor.
